This is a simple Flask application that uses SQLAlchemy to
manage a library database.

It defines several API endpoints to interact with the
library database, including:
- Retrieving all books
- Adding a new author
- Adding a new book
- Deleting a book

The application uses SQLite as the database backend and
Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML pages.
The application is designed to be run locally and opens
a web browser to display the home page when started.
